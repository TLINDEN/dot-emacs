- adapted use-package, got rid of all locally installed packages
- use el-get for non-packages
- re-organized emacs config: ~/.emacs.d/init.el is now the starting point.
  ~/.emacs.d/conf-lisp/ contains init files (one per mode or topic) and
  ~/.emacs.d/init/ contains symlinks to them. That way it is very easy to
disable a module without needing to comment code or loosing something.
- put this repo directly into ~/.emacs.d/.
